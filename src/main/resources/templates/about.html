<h3>Colorado</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Each district shall be as compact in area as possible and the aggregate linear distance of all district boundaries shall be as short as possible. Each district shall consist of contiguous whole general election precincts. Districts of the same house shall not overlap</li>
        <li>Except when necessary to meet the equal population requirements of section 46, no part of one county shall be added to all or part of another county in forming districts. Within counties whose territory is contained in more than one district of the same house, the number of cities and towns whose territory is contained in more than one district of the same house shall be as small as possible. When county, city, or town boundaries are changed, adjustments, if any, in legislative districts shall be as prescribed by law. </li>
        <li>Consistent with the provisions of this section and section 46 of this article, communities of interest, including ethnic, cultural, economic, trade area, geographic, and demographic factors, shall be preserved within a single district wherever possible.</li>
        <li>Follow Section 2 of Voting Rights Act</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Both congressional and state legislative districts be contiguous, as compact as possible, and recognize and consider communities of common 'social, cultural, racial, ethnic, and economic' interests</li>
        <li>Except as otherwise provided in this section, each election precinct shall be composed of contiguous and compact areas having clearly observable boundaries using visible ground features which meet the requirements of the federal bureau of the census and which coincide with census block boundaries as established by the federal bureau of the census and shall be wholly contained within any larger district from which any municipal, township or county officers are elected</li>
        <li>Election precincts for election purposes shall be designated consecutively in the county by number or name, or a combination of name and number;
        </li>
        <li>Any municipal exclave or township enclave shall be a separate precinct and designated by a separate number or name, or combination of name and number, and shall not be identified with or as a part of any other municipal or township precinct
        </li>
        <li>From and after the time that the legislature has been redistricted in 1992, precincts shall be arranged so that no precinct lies in more than one legislative district</li>
        <li>a street or other roadway which has been platted but not graded is not a visible or observable feature for the purposes of this section</li>
        <li>Where a legislative district boundary coincides with a municipal boundary which is changed by reason of annexation, such legislative district boundary shall be maintained as a precinct boundary until the next legislative redistricting regardless of whether such a legislative district boundary uses a visible ground feature or coincides with a census block boundary.</li>

<h3>Missouri</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>Like all states, Missouri must comply with constitutional equal population requirements; for its state legislative lines, Missouri further asks districts to be as nearly equally populated "as possible." [Mo. Const. art. III, §§ 2, 5, 7]</li>
        <li>Missouri must also, like all states, abide by section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</li>
        <li>Missouri also requires both congressional and state legislative districts to be contiguous, and as compact "as may be." The state further requires that county lines not be divided in drawing state Senate districts, except where otherwise required by law. [Mo. Const. art. III, §§ 2, 5, 7, 45]
        </li>

<h2>All states must follow Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as listed below</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act blocks district lines that deny minority voters an equal opportunity "to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." It applies whether the denial is intentional, or an unintended end result. Courts essentially test whether the way that districts are drawn takes decisive political power away from a cohesive minority bloc otherwise at risk for discrimination.</li>

    <li>There are three threshold conditions for a court finding that districts need to be redrawn because section 2 has been violated. (These are often called Gingles conditions, after the Supreme court's Thornburg v. Gingles case.) The first asks whether it is possible to draw a district so that a majority of voters belong to a geographically "compact" racial, ethnic, or language minority community. Compactness has never been precisely defined in this context, but generally refers to populations that are not particularly "far-flung," and where the boundaries are fairly regular, without extensive tendrils. This first Gingles condition basically tests whether a sufficiently large minority population is geographically distributed so that they could control a reasonable district.</li>

    <li>The second Gingles condition tests whether the minority population usually votes as a bloc, for the same type of candidate. This is a nuanced test: not whether the community usually votes for Democrats or Republicans (or others), but whether they would, given a fair mix of candidates, vote for the same type of Democrats or Republicans (or others).</li>

    <li>The third Gingles condition tests the potential competition: whether the rest of the population in the area usually votes as a bloc for different candidates than those preferred by the minority community. If so, this would mean that the minority's preferred candidate would almost always lose -- if the minority community's voting power were not specifically protected. Together, the second and third conditions are known generally as "racially polarized" voting.</li>

    <li>If the three threshold conditions above have been met, courts then look to the "totality of the circumstances" to determine whether the minority vote has been diluted, drawing from the U.S. Senate's legislative report when the Voting Rights Act was passed. Most of these circumstances relate to the extent of historical or contextual discrimination. One factor that has been singled out as particularly important is rough proportionality: whether minorities have the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice in a number of districts roughly proportional to the percentage of minority voters in the population as a whole. Section 2 does not guarantee proportionality. But if a minority group with 20% of a state's eligible population could already elect representatives in 20% of the state's districts, courts will be more hesitant to find a violation of section 2 even if the three Gingles conditions are met. And if the minority group does not have such an opportunity, courts will often be more prone to find a violation.</li>

    <li>Courts have largely articulated Section 2's meaning after plans have been drawn and challenged, and so the tests above are framed retroactively. For those drawing the lines and seeking to avoid legal trouble, the usual technique involves protecting substantial minority populations in racially polarized areas, by drawing district lines so that those minorities have the functional opportunity to elect a representative of their choice.</li>
